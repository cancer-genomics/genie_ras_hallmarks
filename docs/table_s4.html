Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/cancer-genomics/genie_ras_hallmarks/tree/4b43036917a0c7fc32331633eb382f4d1485c867" target="_blank">4b43036</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.DS_Store
    Ignored:    output/.DS_Store
    Ignored:    output/co-mutation/.DS_Store
    Ignored:    public/.DS_Store
    Ignored:    public/table/.DS_Store

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/table_s10.Rmd
    Modified:   analysis/table_s4.Rmd
    Modified:   analysis/table_s7.Rmd
    Modified:   analysis/table_s8.Rmd
    Modified:   analysis/table_s9.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/table_s4.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/table_s4.html</code>) files. If you've configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.
